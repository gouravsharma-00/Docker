# Node.js Docker Example

This project demonstrates a simple Node.js application containerized with Docker. The app returns a JSON message when accessed.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

## Project Structure

The project should include the following files:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .dockerignore
```

- `main.js`: A simple Node.js application.
- `Dockerfile`: The Docker configuration file.
- `.dockerignore`: which files needs to be ignored during the build.

## app.js

Create a simple `main.js` file with the following code:

```javascript
// main.js
// JavaScript: Docker

import express from 'express';
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const App = express()

App.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Docker is easy üê≥'})
})

App.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on PORT: ${PORT}`);
})
```

## Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image from the Docker Hub
FROM node:18

# Create and set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the application dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"] # or CMD ["node", "main.js"]
```

## Steps to Build and Run the Docker Container

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   Run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app:1.0 .
   ```

   Here, `-t my-node-app` assigns a tag name (`my-node-app`) to the image, `:1.0` is the version and the `.` indicates the current directory where the `Dockerfile` is located.

2. **Run the Docker Container**

   Once the image is built, you can run the container using:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:8080 my-node-app
   ```

   This maps port 8080 of the container to port 3000 of the host, making the app accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Access the Application**

   Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to access:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```

   You should see a JSON response:

   ```json
   {
       "message": "Docker is easy üê≥"
   }
   ```

4. **Stop the Running Container**

   To stop the container, press `CTRL + C` in the terminal where the container is running. Alternatively, you can find the container ID by running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   And then stop it using:

   ```bash
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```

## Additional Commands

- **List all Docker images**

  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

- **Remove a Docker image**

  ```bash
  docker rmi my-node-app:1.0
  ```

- **List all running containers**

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **List all containers (including stopped ones)**

  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```

## Notes

- Make sure to have `express` installed locally before building the Docker image:

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  npm install express
  ```
